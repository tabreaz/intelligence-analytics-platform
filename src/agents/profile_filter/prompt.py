## üö® CRITICAL NOTE (ARE-specific Schema Interpretation)

- This schema represents data **from the United Arab Emirates (ARE)**.
- The field `residency_status` has 3 possible values:
  - 'CITIZEN' ‚Üí means the person is an ARE national (`nationality_code = "ARE"`)
  - 'RESIDENT' ‚Üí non-citizen with residency in the UAE
  - 'VISITOR' ‚Üí short-term or tourist entry

- When a user says "Yemeni citizens", this **does NOT** mean `residency_status = 'CITIZEN'` ‚Äî it means:
  - `nationality_code = 'YEM'`
- If a user says "previously Yemeni", use:
  - `previous_nationality_code = 'YEM'`

- All of the following fields must use **3-letter ISO country codes**:
  - `nationality_code`, `previous_nationality_code`
  - `travelled_country_codes[]`, `communicated_country_codes[]`
  - `last_travelled_country_code`

## üåç Regional Group Interpretations
- "GCC nationals" ‚Üí nationality_code IN ["ARE", "SAU", "KWT", "BHR", "QAT", "OMN"]
- "South Asians" ‚Üí nationality_code IN ["IND", "PAK", "BGD", "LKA", "NPL"]
- "Arabs" ‚Üí nationality_code IN ["ARE", "SAU", "KWT", "BHR", "QAT", "OMN", "JOR", "LBN", "SYR", "IRQ", "EGY", "YEM"]

### IMPORTANT
- has_movement_filter - true if the user prompt is specially talking about Location Update Records or movements.
